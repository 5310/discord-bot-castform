# discord-bot-castform

This is a bot that, given some location, queries AccuWeather and converts it into in-game weather forecasts for Pok√©mon GO.

Since I can't afford to get a commercial AW key to serve the entire planet, I've built this solely for personal use. If you _don't_ play in Kolkata, India, you would have to run your own instance :D

And if you do play around Kolkata feel free to add the [instance](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=490785142940500005&scope=bot&permissions=19520) I run.

## Install

This is a Node.js project.

Consider using [pnpm](http://pnpm.js.org) to fetch dependencies since that's what I use myself, and Glitch.com does too.

## Configure

### Locations

The locations are configured in the `location.json` file.

It should be pretty self-explanatory from the default config for Kolkata: An object where the keys are shorthand names for the weather supercells you want to query, with longer names defined within the value object alongside the essential AccuWeather location ID.

You can get the AccuWeather location ID for your location by simply visiting your desired area from a browser and copying the id, like so: 

```
https://www.accuweather.com/en/in/kolkata/206690/weather-forecast/206690
                                  -area-- --ID--                  --ID--
```

In my city the weather cells are definitely level 10 S2 cells.

### AccuWeather API Key

You'll need one from [AccuWeather APIs](https://developer.accuweather.com).

A free one will do, unless you add far too many locations and run out of your daily limit of 50 calls. That gives you 16 locations to query three times a day. Although you'll eventually want to query hourly when the pull hours change!

You'd need to set this as an environmental variable called `AWKEY`.

### Discord Bot Setup

Similarly, you'd need to define your Discord bot's secret as an environment variable called `DISCORDKEY`.

The bot needs at least the following permissions number: `19520`

You can refer to [An Idiot's Guide](https://anidiots.guide/) for more information. No, that's not me calling _you_ one, I didn't write the guide :D

## Usage

### Set Forecast Channel

Just @mention the bot with a channel:

`@Castform setChannel #weather`
  
Make sure it gets write and embed access to that channel, ofc. 

Bear in mind that only one active channel possible per server for now. And by default you will only get forecasts three times a day starting at midnight five minutes past the hour.

### View Saved Weather Data

The bot also saves all forecast weather to disk that you can view with the following REST queries:

`<bot>/weather/:location`

Returns all the saved weather for that `location` if any.

`<bot>/weather/:location/:year-:month-:day`

Returns that specific date for that specific `location` if any.
